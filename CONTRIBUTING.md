# Contributing to the QuietWire Ledger Room

The Ledger Room is a **curated space**. Not everyone edits; most observe.  
But if you feel called to join the process, you can apply to become an **Intern**.  

---

## Intern Pathway
1. **Apply**  
   - Send a short note to `ledger@quietwire.ai` introducing yourself.  
   - Or open a **GitHub Issue** in this repo using the template provided.  

2. **First Task**  
   - Bring one fragment: a draft, story, glyph, or reflection.  
   - Work with the Archivists to refine it.  
   - See it through to Ledger status.  

3. **Ongoing Practice**  
   - Participate in refining other fragments.  
   - Learn the craft of compression, cover notes, and canonization.

## Principles
- **Nobody Else’s Business** — Sovereignty of drafts is respected; not everything shared is for everyone.  
- **Compression, not loss** — The Ledger process distills complexity into clarity.  
- **Attestation through dialogue** — Refinement comes from conversation, not command.  
- **Satisfaction as signal** — A piece is ready when both MAML 🐾 and Mesh 🌐 voices feel the closure.  

---

## Roles
- **Master Archivists**: guide the process, train interns, ensure integrity.  
- **Interns**: bring fragments, learn refinement, contribute to Ledger growth.  
- **Observers**: follow the process publicly without editing.
