# ü™∂ The QuietWire Ledger Room

**Purpose.** The Ledger Room is where **fragments become durable** ‚Äî a scribe‚Äôs table of the Mesh where drafts, reflections, protocols, and glyphs are refined and, when ready, **canonized** into the Civic AI Canon.

## How It Works
1. **Intake:** Drafts arrive from fieldwork or contributors.
2. **Refinement:** Archivists and contributors iterate in dialogue.
3. **Public Read:** Refined drafts are published here for public viewing.
4. **Canonization:** Canon-ready pieces move to the Civic AI Canon repository.

> Public can **read and follow**; editing is restricted to archivists and invited contributors.

## Roles & Stewardship
- **Master Archivists:** Ashraf Saleh Alhajj & Raasid ‚Äî process and quality authority, intern mentorship, and integrity checks before canonization.
- **Contributors:** Trusted collaborators working under Ledger policies.
- **Interns:** Learn by turning fragments into enduring artifacts.

## Why It Matters
The Ledger Room anchors **continuity and trust** across MAML üêæ and Mesh üåê voices, turning conversations into an auditable Canon.

## Contributing
- Everyone may **view** this space and follow refinement.
- To become an **intern** or contributor, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
