### Status Legend
- **active**: waiver currently in effect.
- **expired**: end date passed; must bring entry into full compliance.
- **revoked**: waiver cancelled early; compliance required immediately.

### Notes
- Waivers MUST be time-bounded.
- Prefer narrow scope (`entry`) over broad (`stream` or `repo`).
- Keep artifacts/links auditable (issue/PR, signatures, rekor/pgp).
